# IDDFS Search Algorithm – Lab Report 01 (CSE316)

This project implements **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)** to find a path in a 2D maze.

## Features
- Reads maze from `input.txt`
- Checks if path exists from start to target
- Moves allowed: up, down, left, right
- Each cell visited only once per path
- Outputs depth and traversal order
