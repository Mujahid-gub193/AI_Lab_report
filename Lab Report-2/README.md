# A* Search Algorithm – Lab Report 02 (CSE316)

This project implements the **A\*** search algorithm to find the shortest path in a 2D grid-based maze.  
The program reads input from `input.txt` and outputs whether a path exists, its cost, and the full path.

---

## Features
- Reads maze layout from `input.txt`
- Implements **A\*** search using:
  - Cost of each move = 1
  - **Manhattan Distance** as heuristic
- Supports movement: **up, down, left, right**
- Detects impossible paths
- Outputs:
  - Whether a path was found
  - Total path cost
  - Coordinates of the full path
