# Graph Coloring using Backtracking

This project implements the Graph Coloring Problem using the Backtracking algorithm.

## Problem Description
Given an undirected graph with N vertices and M edges, determine whether the graph can be colored using K colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

## Algorithm
- Backtracking
- Safety check before assigning color

## How to Run
1. Place input in `input.txt`
2. Run:
